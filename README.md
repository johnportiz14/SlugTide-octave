# SlugTide-octave


SlugTide is a suite of MATLAB codes that is used to analyze tidal responses from water well data. These codes were developed in the University of California, Santa Cruz Seismology lab to study tidal responses following earthquakes and to analyze permeability changes across fault zones.

The SlugTide code is freely available for academic and non-profit use. 

I am neither the creator nor owner of SlugTide. This repository documents my efforts to modify the SlugTide distribution into a form that can be used by the free and open-source software, Octave (https://octave.org/).
I have also included some helper scripts to perform some of the data pre-processing, interfacing with SPOTL for the theoretical tidal loads, and interpretation of hydrogeologic parameters.
