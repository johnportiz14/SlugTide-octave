The individual water level data is included as a Matlab structure AllData in
the data repository of this article. For each water well, the fields: water
level above the sensor as measured by the pressure transducer (Dep) [m], the
corresponding time for each sample in UTC time (TimeUTC), well name (WellName),
the radius of casing (RCasing) [m], the radius of the well (RWell) [m], and the
length of the open interval (LInterval) [m].
